html5-revolution
================

An impress.js powered presentation about the rise of HTML5 and death of plugins.

This is the presentation I delivered as part of the [HTML5 - It Just Got Real](http://html5-it-just-got-real.com/) event. A big 'thank you' to [Graham Odds](https://github.com/godds) for providing the SVG graphics and general styling.
